The characteristics of all social action projects are determined by three parameters:

- Type of engagement. This is the 'format' for taking part in the action; e.g. a group that has its own reason for existing that happens to do some relevant activities; or a structured programme which is a contained set of interactions with a clear start and end point, or an event which is a one off engagement.
- Type of activity. This is the nature of the action being taken - for example, campaigning, volunteering, fundraising...
- Restrictions. This are requirements or limits that the organiser has determined for how people can take part.
